	 			<h2>Mick Fowler - 115 Victoria St</h2>
	 			<div class="articleScroll">
		 			<p>115 Victoria St was once home to a man named Mick Fowler, a seaman, jazz musician and all round good-time guy who led Victoria Street's resident action against the Victoria Heights high-rise development in the early 1970s.
	            	Mick had lived here fairly peaceably for some years as a boarder, upstairs from his mother who also rented one of the building's many rooms. One day, returning from a long voyage out to sea, he found his mother sitting on the front step, surrounded by their belongings, and clutching to fifty dollars paid to her by a developer to help cover the cost of moving and storage.</p>
	            	<p>The developer was a man named Frank Theeman, who planned to demolish the properties along the north side of the street in order to build a new block of high rise apartments.Today most of us would probably just take the cash. But Mick Fowler went on to contest the eviction, and his fight to stay put in his rented room at 115 Victoria St became emblematic of the fight of the working class man against the forces of wealth and privilege, a struggle over the the right to live in the inner city suburbs of Sydney.</p>
	            	<p>His battlecry - 'Across the Western Suburbs We Must Wander' - was a tirade against the banishment of working families from the communities in which they'd lived and worked for generations.</p>
